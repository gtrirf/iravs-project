## Prerequisites

### 1. Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate into the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtrirf/iravs-project.git
cd iravs-project
```

### 2. Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On **Linux / macOS**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
